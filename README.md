* This repository contains the Python Beginner Level problem statements and their solutions. I collected it to practice and solve all the listed problems with python.

* If you have some good beginner level problem statements which clear the concepts and/or you can solve these [exercise](https://github.com/kwattorama/p_for_python/blob/master/exercise.py) in better way using another method then feel free to make commit and improve this repository. 

* If you are a newbie then I hope this [exercise](https://github.com/kwattorama/p_for_python/blob/master/exercise.py) will help you to get your hands free with python. 

* In this repository, I will be gradually add problems statements with my own solutions. Also, I may try to explain the code via comments.
